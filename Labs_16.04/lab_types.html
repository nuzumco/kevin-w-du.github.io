<h2>Vulnerability and Attack Labs</h2>
<p>
The goal of these labs is to achieve learning from mistakes. 
Vulnerabilities are often caused by mistakes in design, implementation, 
and configuration. Not many students can gain a full
understanding of vulnerabilities and their corresponding attacks
without going through some attacks first hand.
We developed labs covering
many common vulnerabilities and attacks.
In each lab, students are given a system (or program) with
hidden vulnerabilities.  Based upon the hints provided,
students must find these vulnerabilities, and
then devise strategies to exploit them.
Furthermore, students need to demonstrate ways to defend
against the attacks or comment on the prevailing mitigating
methods and their effectiveness. Each lab
takes one to two weeks--10 hours per week--for average students.
</p>


<h2>Exploration Labs</h2>
<p>
The objective of the exploration labs are intended to enhance
students' learning via observation, playing and exploration, so they can
understand what security principles "feel" like in a real system; and
to provide students with opportunities to apply security
principles in analyzing and evaluating systems.
To use an analogy, exploration labs are like a "guided tour" of a system, 
in which, students can "touch" and "interact with" 
the key components of a security system to learn the principles of 
security.
</p>


<h2>Design and Implemenation Labs</h2>
<p>
The goal of these labs is to achieve learning by system development.
They allow student to apply security principles, concepts, and 
ideas to build a secure systems in a lab environment.
In security education, students should also be given opportunities to
apply security principles in designing and implementing systems.
However, building a meaningful system usually takes longer than
possible in a semester long course.
</p>
<p>
We identified  several systems suitable for secure systems
education, including firewalls, IPSec, Virtual Private
Networks (VPN), access control systems in operating systems,
and encrypted file systems. Each system
covers a broad scope of security principles, making them
suitable for projects. To make projects achievable within 4-6
weeks, we reduced the system functionalities,
but we kept those essential for security.
We also provided supporting materials to help students reduce time expended on
necessary but non-essential--to security--functionalities.
