<h2>Workshop 2019</h2>


<p>
The objective of the SEED workshops is to provide training to the instructors
who are interested in using SEED labs in their courses. 
During the workshops, instructors will work on the SEED labs that they are
interested in, with the help from us. We will also share with the instructors
our experience in using these SEED labs. 
Each year, we hold two workshops at Syracuse University. 
The 2019 workshops will be held in the following days: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <b>May 29</b> (Wednesday) - <b>June 1</b> (Saturday), 2019: We start 
	     the first workshop on Wednesday because Monday is a holiday.
             Those who have to leave on Friday should feel free to do so.  
	     <p/>
	<li> <b>June 3</b> (Monday) - <b>June 6</b> (Thursday), 2019. </li> 
	     <p/>
	     <li> <font color="red"></font>Here is last year's 
	     <a href="workshop_agenda2018.html">agenda.</a></li>
</ul>


</p>

<p> We will accept a total of 80 participants for the workshops (40 for each).
Eligible participants will receive a stipend of $1200 for attending the workshop. 
The selection will be done based on several criteria, including coverage,
diversity, and needs. <b>This will be the last workshop that we can hold under the 
	current grant.</b>
</p>
Please fill in this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/X80NFdJywbvhV5gb2">pre-application form</a> 
if you are interested in attending the workshop. The purpose of this 
pre-application
is to get your contact information, so
when the official application opens in March 2019, those who have submitted the 
pre-application will be invited to apply first (officially). 
If we still have space left, we
will open it up to others. 
<p/>
<ul>
<li>Our grant can only cover the participants from US-based
schools.  If you are not from US or not an instructor, we may accept
your application if seats are still available, but you will not receive
a stipend (the workshop will still be free). In the last 4 years, we had a
number of self-sponsored international participants. 
<p/>
<li>Due to the limitation of funds, those who have already attended our 
last two years' workshops will not be eligible to apply. Those who attended the 
2015 or 2016 workshops are eligible to apply, but preferences will be given to 
new participants.
<p/>
<li>Participants are expected to bring their own computers, which need to  
have VirtualBox software installed. The minimum requirement of RAM is 4GB. 
</ul>
</p>
